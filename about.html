    <h2>About Lucas </h2>
    <p>Lucas (<em>Homo erectus</em>) is native to parts of Western Europe. Vlijmen to be specific.. Its conservation status is currently <strong>annoying</strong>.<br /><br /> There are many subspecies within the Lucas de Man species, including the &#960; formula and the <strong> flexing </strong>. Lucas de Man is similar to </em> Ronnie Flex</em> all the flex is in the last-name. But for Lucas the case is with masculinity.</p>
